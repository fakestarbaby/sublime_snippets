# Sublime Text 2 Snippets

These are the Sublime Text 2 snippets. Installation on OS X is as follows:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/
git clone git@github.com:FakeStarBaby/sublime_snippets.git
```

Installation on Windows and Linux should be the same apart from a different Packages directory.
